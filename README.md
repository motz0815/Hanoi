# Towers of Hanoi (C)
## Purpose
This is just a little school project, there's not even grading on it.

## How To Run
You'll have to compile it yourself using gcc (or similar, whatever you like).
PS: I compiled the project with the C++14 standard, on UNIX (Darwin/macOS).

## misc
Furthermore, I might add Windows compatibilty someday.
