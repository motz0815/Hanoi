# Towers of Hanoi (C)
## Purpose
This is just a little school project, it's not even gonna be graded.

## Prerequisites
You can use Windows or Unix/Linux to run this project, as it is fully compatible with both.

## How To Run
You'll have to compile it yourself using gcc (or similar, whatever you like).

PS: I compiled the project with the C++14 standard, on UNIX (Darwin/macOS).
